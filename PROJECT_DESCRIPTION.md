# Cultura Atlas - AI-Powered Cultural Itinerary Planner

## Inspiration

In today's interconnected world, cultural exploration has become more accessible than ever, yet many travelers still miss the authentic, deeply personal experiences that truly connect them to local cultures. We were inspired by the challenge of bridging the gap between global accessibility and authentic cultural immersion.

**Cultura Atlas** was born from the realization that:
- Traditional travel planning often focuses on tourist hotspots rather than cultural authenticity
- AI has the potential to understand and match individual tastes with cultural experiences
- There's a growing desire for personalized, culturally-rich travel experiences

We envisioned a platform that could act as a knowledgeable local guide, understanding not just what you want to see, but why you want to see it, and how it connects to your broader cultural interests.
